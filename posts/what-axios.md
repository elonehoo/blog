The java application with the same name as the front end axios is a faster, lighter, and simpler HTTPS tool.

## Introduce

I have used OkHttp for a while during development. The complexity of the code is too confusing for me, and I use a lot of repeated code, but it cannot be completely extracted into a unified method. This made it hard for me to understand, and it turned out to be a tool for making a simple HTTP request, as simple as the front-end axios.

In the design process of the API, try to use the same naming method, so that more back-end programmers can reduce the cost of learning and the time cost of reading documents when creating front-end tools. I think this is meaningful. thing. In the future, json parsing will be added, and it will become more simple and clear.
