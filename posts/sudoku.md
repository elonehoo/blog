Analyzing how to write Sudoku games, I will explain the ideas and methods of Sudoku games from the perspective of vue3.

## First step

We need to understand what is Sudoku?

> The puzzle is a square of nine squares (ie, 3Ã—3 squares high), and each square is subdivided into a nine-square. In each small nine square, fill in the numbers from 1 to 9, so that the numbers in each column and each row of the entire big nine square are not repeated. The gameplay logic of Sudoku is simple, and the arrangement of numbers is ever-changing.

So is the answer to Sudoku unique?

> According to [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku), there is only one Sudoku answer on media release.

## Second step

To complete the Sudoku algorithm, here I use the open source [sudoku.js](https://github.com/robatron/sudoku.js) as the core algorithm for generating questions.

## Third step

Initially, I tried sudoku generated by "sudoku.js". But it doesn't handle the difficulty properly. An "easy" Sudoku is not that easy, and can be difficult at times! Also, the filling is uneven. Sometimes, entire rows/columns/boxes are filled!

So I left the 'sudoku.js' code the same, except for the minimal changes required to import it here.

```typescript
 /**
  * The Sudoku position is 9x9.
  *    A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9
  *    B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9
  *    C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9
  *    D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9
  *    E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 E9
  *    F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9
  *    G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 G6 G7 G8 G9
  *    H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 H7 H8 H9
  *    I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I6 I7 I8 I9
  *
  * It can be considered to be comprised of 9 boxes
  * each, stacked in a 3x3 formation.
  * Like this: Box1 Box2 Box3
  *            Box4 Box5 Box6
  *            Box7 Box8 Box9
  *
  * In turn, each box is comprised of 9 cells stacked
  * in a 3x3 formation as above. This gives us the below
  * representation:
  *      Box1        Box2        Box3
  *    A1 A2 A3    A4 A5 A6    A7 A8 A9
  *    B1 B2 B3    B4 B5 B6    B7 B8 B9
  *    C1 C2 C3    C4 C5 C6    C7 C8 C9
  *      Box4        Box5        Box6
  *    D1 D2 D3    D4 D5 D6    D7 D8 D9
  *    E1 E2 E3    E4 E5 E6    E7 E8 E9
  *    F1 F2 F3    F4 F5 F6    F7 F8 F9
  *      Box7        Box8        Box9
  *    G1 G2 G3    G4 G5 G6    G7 G8 G9
  *    H1 H2 H3    H4 H5 H6    H7 H8 H9
  *    I1 I2 I3    I4 I5 I6    I7 I8 I9
  *
  * For example, Box1 has the following cells:
  * Box1: A1 A2 A3
  *       B1 B2 B3
  *       C1 C2 C3
  *
  * So in Box1,
  *    Cell1: A1   Cell2: A2   Cell3: A3
  *    Cell4: B1   Cell5: B2   Cell6: B3
  *    Cell7: C1   Cell8: C2   Cell9: C3
  *
  * and in Box8,
  *    Cell1: G4   Cell2: G5   Cell3: G6
  *    Cell4: H4   Cell5: H5   Cell6: H6
  *    Cell7: I4   Cell8: I5   Cell9: I6
  *
  * and so on...
